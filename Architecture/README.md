# Architecture Notes

This codebase prefers organization by user flow and use case rather than by technical concern.

## Core Principle

Keep things together that belong together.

The main goal is locality of behavior:

- related UI, state, workflows, and helpers should live near each other
- working on a feature should not require jumping across unrelated namespaces
- boundaries should reflect user-visible behavior and system capabilities

## Preferred Shape

Good boundaries usually look like:

- `MenuBarStatus/`
- `DeviceInventory/`
- `SoundDevicesWindow/`
- `PriorityOrder/`
- `OutputSwitching/`
- `DeviceMatching/`
- `SettingsSync/`
- `FirstRun/`

Within a feature area, prefer small named objects such as:

- `Workflow`
- `Coordinator`
- `Navigator`
- `Store`
- `Factory`
- `Resolver`
- `Builder`

These names should describe a real role in the feature, not just wrap displaced code.

## What To Avoid

Avoid creating or growing broad cross-cutting buckets such as:

- `Services/`
- `Managers/`
- `Helpers/`
- `Utilities/`

Avoid extracting code just to deduplicate incidental duplication. Shared abstractions should be introduced carefully and only when the shared concept is real.

## Shared Code Rule

`Shared/` is a high bar, not a default destination.

Only move something into `Shared/` when:

- at least two distinct flows clearly depend on it
- the concept remains coherent outside its original feature
- the move improves clarity more than it increases indirection

## Refactor Heuristics

When changing code:

1. Move related files closer together first.
2. Extract small feature-local collaborators second.
3. Reevaluate whether any higher-level abstraction is actually necessary.

When touching a large file:

- prefer carving out focused, named collaborators
- keep those collaborators in the same feature directory by default
- stop extracting when the top-level object becomes a clear composer rather than a god object

## Reference Example

No feature has been named as the reference example yet. Once one clearly shows the desired direction, name it here. It should have:

- thin top-level view composition
- feature-local workflows and coordinators
- nearby state and supporting objects
- user-behavior-driven names
